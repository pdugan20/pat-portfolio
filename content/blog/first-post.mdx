Last month, I published an [iMessage-centric UI kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1519446101653617639/imessage-chat-builder) in the Figma community - the purpose of which was to act as the source components for a [companion AI plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1519731262843198057/imessage-ai-chat-builder) I wanted to develop. In the course of building out and documenting that design system at a component and variable level, I thought it would be fun to put together a list of best practices with an eye toward calling out specific choices that might contribute toward making that system work well with Figma's native AI toolset as well as with third-party AI tools like the one I would go on to build.

## Background

In my role as a designer at Meta, I've helped contribute to and design the system that [Facebook Messenger](http://messenger.com) is constructed from - both in Figma and in code. Whenever you're working with a mature design system, in this case one that that saw its last major facelift almost [half a decade ago](https://design.facebook.com/blog/the-new-messenger-brand-nothings-changed-everythings-changed/), many of the contributions you'll end up making will be smaller, intentionally scoped changes that incrementally make improvements while aiming to be minimally disruptive to users. That adage becomes more true when you're working on a system that powers a product with a large installed user-base that also happens to be change averse.

While I've built design systems from scratch at [Quora](https://www.qurora.com), at the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://www.czi.com), and for various zero-to-one work I've taken on over the years, I realized it had been a minute! The last time I had truly built a design system end-to-end when I was still actively working on [Hikearound](https://www.tryhikearound.com), so it was quite a bit of fun to jump into a blank file and get rolling.

Funnily enough, I didn't actually set out to build out Apple's messaging design system in Figma. Apple released their own [messaging design library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1367916269438172112/imessage-apps-and-stickers) in 2024, and I initially thought I'd be able to leverage this resource for the plugin I was trying to build. I realized pretty quickly unfortunately that wasn't going to be possible. Despite being less than a year old, Apple's self-published library was designed somewhat crudely. The components weren't built with auto-layout support and in many cases the UI throughout the file didn't match the production versions of Apple iMessage. Additionally the color and typography variables included in the file were a bit all over the place. Rather than try to modify and update their library as-is, I pivoted to building my own.

## Getting started

At the start of any project, and building out a design system is no different, it's key to understand what your goals are and the audience you'll be designing for. In this case I wanted a library to would work well at a programatic level, but also one that designers could use to construct UI independent of any AI tooling.

With that in mind I landed on designing a system that:

- Was limited primarily to two screens: the iMessage **Inbox and Thread** views
- **Limited its typographic and color variable system**, primarily for simplicity
- Included standalone components that covered common use-cases while also **building and documenting primitives** for anyone looking to extend the system further
- Included **standard utility components** for common use-cases like documenting component usage and easily applying user personas

It would be easy for a project like this to continue growing in scope, so I approached scoping my initial pass as what I'd consider the MVP version of what would make the library useful to others.

I'd consider a best-in-class example of how to architect a design system as being Figma's self-published [Simple Design System](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1380235722331273046/simple-design-system), and I used this as a jumping off point for my own pass.
