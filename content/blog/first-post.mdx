Last month, I published an [iMessage-centric UI kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1519446101653617639/imessage-chat-builder) in the Figma community - the purpose of which was to act as the source components for a [companion AI plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1519731262843198057/imessage-ai-chat-builder) I wanted to develop. In the course of building out and documenting that design system at a component and variable level, I thought it would be fun to put together a list of best practices with an eye toward calling out specific choices that might contribute toward making that system work well with Figma's native AI toolset as well as with third-party AI tools like the one I would go on to build.

In my role as a designer at Meta, I helped contribute to and design the system that [Facebook Messenger](http://messenger.com) is built from - both in Figma and in code. Whenever you're working with a mature design system, in this case one that that saw its last major facelift almost [half a decade ago](https://design.facebook.com/blog/the-new-messenger-brand-nothings-changed-everythings-changed/), many of the contributions you'll end up making will be smaller, intentionally scoped changes that incrementally make improvements while aiming to be minimally disruptive to users. That becomes even more true when you're working on a system and product with a large user-base that also happens to be change averse. All of that is to say the last time I had truly built a design system from scratch in Figma was when I was still actively working on [Hikearound](https://www.tryhikearound.com), so it was quite a bit of fun to jump into a blank file and get rolling.
