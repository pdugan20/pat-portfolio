A comprehensive portfolio website that showcases my work, skills, and experience. Built with modern web technologies and designed with a focus on performance, accessibility, and user experience.

## Technical Implementation

This portfolio uses Next.js 15 with the App Router for optimal performance and developer experience. Here's an example of the layout structure:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="app/layout.tsx">
{`import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Geist } from 'next/font/google';
import './globals.css';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@/components/ThemeProvider';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Software Developer',
  description: 'Software developer passionate about creating beautiful applications',
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className={geistSans.variable}>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}`}
</CodeBlock>

/>

## Key Features

The portfolio includes several advanced features:

- **MDX Support**: Blog posts and project pages can include React components
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic theme detection with manual toggle
- **SEO Optimization**: Proper meta tags and structured data
- **Performance**: Optimized images and code splitting
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

This demonstrates how you can now use React components directly in your project files to create rich, interactive content!
