# Building My Portfolio with Next.js

I recently built this portfolio website using Next.js 15 with the App Router and MDX for blog posts. Here's what I learned along the way.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with:

- Fast development server
- Built-in TypeScript support
- App Router for modern routing
- Easy deployment options

## Key Features

- **MDX Support**: Using `next-mdx-remote` for dynamic content
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

The combination of these technologies makes for a powerful and maintainable portfolio site.
